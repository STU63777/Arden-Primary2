        <p>Arden Primary school was established in 1940 and have been providing education to children for the past 80 years. Through out that time we have become more and more modern.</p>
<p> We now provide a coach service to help the children and parents get there without being late while also not having to worry about travel arrangements, such as public transport or car. The coach service is completely free provided you are enrolled at Arden Primary.</p>
<p> We are recommended by ofsted because they gave us a grade 1 for excellent in our learning and school environment.</p>
<p>Recently we refurbished some of our classrooms to make them look and be more practical for the learning of our students. We take learning very seriously so as to make sure the student has a great a start as possible for a bright future.</p>
