        <h6>School Council</h6> 
<p><img src="Images/Children.jpg" align=left width=155 height=140>We now have a school council for the children to influence some of the ways the school is run. We think doing this will help us hear more of the children's ideas and help improve quality of life for kids during school time. This can be something minor for instance some food ideas, or perhaps more bins around the school.We also think that this make the kids stay </p>
          <h6>After School Clubs</h6>
          <p>Last month we started a scheme for after school clubs to help keep the children entertained; while they wait for their parents to arrive and take them home. We have an art club, maths club and sports club in place to make sure that the kids can still learn while they wait. We do understand that parents can be busy with so we thought we would give back by starting these clubs.

          <tr><th>Attendance Percentage</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr><td>95%-100%</td><td>This is really good because any student who can keep this up through out the year will recieve a reward and certificate for good attendance.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>90%-95%</td><td>This is still pretty good however could still see improvement if possible</td></tr>
     <tr><td>85%-90%</td><td>At this we will need to talk to the parents to arrange a meeting to see if there is any problems that could be fixed to improve attendance</td></tr>
    <tr><td>80% or less</td><td>We may have to consider legal action in an attempt to make sure the child still has good future with learning or he/she may have to change schools</td></tr>
