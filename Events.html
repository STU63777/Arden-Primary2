      <h1>Events</h1>
<p>Through out the month of may we did a bake sale for the charity called st jude which is a charity that helps kids that are going through cancer. While doing the bake sale we managed to raise around £5,000. We did a lot of the sales through the kids baking cookies and biscuits etc. we also sold hot drinks such as coffee and tea. So on behalf of Arden Primary we would just like to thank the kids so much for helping us raise so much for a such a wonderful charity, we could not of done it without them.</p>

      <h1> World Book Day</h1>
      <p>During march we did a day called world book day which meant that through the help of the charity called World Book Day. This is a copyrighted charity and their mission is to make sure that every child has a book. A child is given a book voucher to redeem to a get a book of their choosing. They may choose any level of diffculty of book because obviously every child is different and reads at their own pace. so because of this we let them choose any book that is available to be redeem via the voucher/ticket they are given.
