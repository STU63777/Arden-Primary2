While the kids learn at our school during in English class they will learn how to read/write and more basic English such as the alphabet or phonics. We are always pushing and striving to improve the grammar or vocabulary used during school to better help the children future.</p>
<p><img src="Images/PE.png" align=left width=130 height=100>Physical Education-<br>
During their time learning with us the the children will learn how to swim, play football, field hockey and rugby. Through this a student may pursue these sports further if they feel they have an interest in them. PE is a vital lesson for the children to learn because it gives them exercise and they get to enjoy sports in an educational setting.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Science.png" align=left width=100 height=70>Science-<br>
We at Arden think it is incredibly important that they students learn science because it helps with an understanding of a lot different things in the world or universe. When the kids learn this they will go through practicals and some of the theory behind the basics of science.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Addition.png" align=left width=130 height=100>Maths-<br>
Maths is incredibly important for a child's future and can be a very fun activity for the kids to enjoy. They will learn basic addition, multiplication, dividing and subtracting to get ready for their later life.When the maths lesson is being taught, it will be taught in a way to make it as fun as possible to make sure that the kids not only learn but also have while doing it.</p>
<p><img src="Images/religions.jpg" align=left width=140 height=100>Religious Education-<br>
At Arden we teach a basic understanding about religion and about what people believe. We also go through the history of some religions so the children know where faith of so many people came from started.</P>
