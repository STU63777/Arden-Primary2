        <h1>News</h1>

<P>So on Thursday 14th October we did a sports day for the children Arden primary, however it was stopped due to a random and unexpected hail storm during the relay event. From this we told all the kids to go home with their parents early. If the children didn't have parents available at the time to pick them up, we had after school clubs running so the kids could be kept entertained while waiting for their parents to arrive.The children did manage to get through the majority of the events such the 100m sprint, discus, 50m sprint and many more. </p><br>
<P>We recently started raising money through early coffee mornings on a friday.At the coffee morning we sell cakes, biscuits, and hot drinks for anyone seeking a pick me up during the morning of friday. We have done this in an effort to get more gym equipment for pe lessons. So far we have managed to get new tennis and ping pong rackets for the use in pe, as well as some new sport balls to be used in various sports.</p><br>
<P>On the date of Wednesday 10th April we had a firefighter instructor come and give a demonstration about how the job is done. He also talked about fire safety at home and basics about how the fire alarm works. later he went on to talk about who and what number to call in an emergency to help save your life.
